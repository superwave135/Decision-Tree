# Decision-Tree
Decision trees are a powerful prediction method and extremely popular. Although the idea behind it is comparatively straightforward, implementing the algorithm from scratch is not as easy. In this tutorial, we will code an ID3 algorithm on a toy dataset step by step. After completing it, you will know:  How to calculate the entropy and information gain. How to apply the information gain to determine the root node for a sub-tree. How to build a decision tree classifier by using ID3(Iterative Dichotomiser 3) algorithm. How to apply the tree/classifier to a given problem.
